# `atils@1.1.0`
Welcome to the latest update for atils!<br>
I know I said that I'd deprecate it, but I lied, because I became creative again... somewhat.

Anyways, I removed the `DateUtility`, `CollectionUtility`, and `RequestUtility` (plus all of their sub-variants), and rewrote every other one. I also added a new EnumUtility and StructureUtility to help a bit more. That's about it.

I might have some examples up in `atils@1.1.2`, but I don't know.

## Little Note
I forgot to add the documentation and stuff, and so we're at `@1.1.0-build` right now. Same thing happened with `@1.0.9`/`-stable` as well.
