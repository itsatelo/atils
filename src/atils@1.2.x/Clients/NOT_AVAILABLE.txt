This was going to be for an Error Client, but since I added the .throw() method to Errors, I felt it was a bit unnecessary.
I can see why it would be used, but I don't think it's something that will be put on my priority list as of yet.

Anyways, if you're reading this, you've been looking through atils' source code!
Whether you're on GitHub, or looking through your node_modules (or whatever folder you use, since you might be using soft) folder...
thanks for using atils!

Over the past 3 months, I've learned a LOT about programming, and have seen that atils has been used by 894 people at the time of writing this, so hopefully I've helped some of you!
Of course, I can't say I haven't installed it a few times myself (to work on different projects and such), but there's still a ton of people that use the package.
It may not be an extremely popular package, no, but it is still something! Especially since I'm a out-of-nowhere developer who's just doing stuff for fun.

Here's a couple fun little facts about the package:
- atils was originally supposed to be specifically for discord.js!

- atils gained a dev package on 3/7/2022, which holds the "concept version" for @1.2.0 (npm install atils-dev@1.2.0-dev if you want it).
  - most of the code here is based off of that concept version, and a couple of the utilities are literally copies of that dev version (Console and Structure).

- "soft" is based off of a utility that was going to be in @1.0.0, but was never added.
    - the utility is a soft-installer, which would've been really bad if it worked...
        - spoiler alert: it never worked, but i did make soft with that failure in mind.

- atils' name is literally just "atelo" + "utils". atelo utils.

- right before @1.1.3 was released, I switched NPM Accounts to my current one (itsatelo).

- atils originally neglected SemVer (the versioning system used by npm)
    - they are supposed to go MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, but I was doing MAJOR.MINOR because I didn't think I'd constantly release patches...
        - I'm still not releasing many patches.
    - in @1.1.x, it started following SemVer.
    - @2.0.0 is never going to be released (as far as I'm currently aware of; my mind changes frequently).
        - this is because I can't constantly keep the package maintained with every little thing that i'd find useful.
        - because of this, we might end up with @1.10.0 or something.
        - this does differentiate from SemVer, because now it's MAJOR/MINOR.PATCH, instead of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

- unless I get a career in programming, @1.2.x will probably be the last series of versions for atils, since I'm becoming more and more preoccupied with other things.

Thank you for using atils; if you have an issue, submit it on GitHub. I'll fix it eventually... maybe.
